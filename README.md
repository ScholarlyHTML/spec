# Scholarly HTML Specification

This repository will host development of the Core Scholarly HTML specification for the Scholarly HTML **format** which is a profile of HTML 5.

As it says [on the web site][schtml] Scholarly HTML is:

Scholarly HTML is four things:

* It’s a movement: committed to bringing scholarship to the web using standard web approaches – ie HTML, and links rather than PDF. Scholarly HTML builds on the ‘Beyond the PDF‘ movement and grew out of the January 2011 meeting in San Diego.


* It’s a format: a ‘profile’ of HTML that sets out conventions for encoding scholarly content in a declarative way using standard approaches such as RDFa and established microformats.

*  It’s a a set of tools: to help authors create Scholarly HTML

* Documentation: how-to guides for the above.

NOTE: HTML5 is now a W3C Recommendation ( http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/ ). Since the tagset is now stable we have a page [tagset.md] for discussing which tags should be part of ScHTML.
